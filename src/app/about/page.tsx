                  The M&amp;A advisory industry has a blind spot. Global firms won&apos;t touch deals under $100M. Local brokers lack the buyer networks, process discipline, and cross-border capability to execute with any consistency. The middle market in Asia was and largely still is underserved.
                </p>
                <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                  Nobridge was founded to fix that. We built an advisory firm specifically for Asian SMEs doing between $2M and $50M in enterprise value. Businesses with strong fundamentals, loyal customers, and owners ready for their next chapter.

                <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                  We combine the rigour of institutional M&amp;A with the speed and access that only a technology-enabled, regionally-embedded firm can offer. The result is faster deals, better outcomes, and a market that finally works for the businesses that power this region&apos;s economy.
