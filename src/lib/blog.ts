    content: `<h2>A shifting landscape</h2><p>Over the past five years, cross-border M&A activity targeting Southeast Asian SMEs has grown steadily. Strategic acquirers from Europe, North America, and North Asia are looking beyond their saturated home markets for businesses with strong fundamentals and regional growth potential.</p><h2>What buyers are looking for</h2><p>The most sought-after targets share common traits: recurring revenue, experienced management teams, clear market positioning, and a credible growth story. Businesses in technology services, healthcare, education, and industrial distribution are seeing particular interest.</p><h2>Implications for owners</h2><p>For SME owners considering an exit, the takeaway is clear: the buyer pool is wider than ever, but preparation matters. A well-positioned business with clean financials and a compelling narrative will attract materially better outcomes than one that goes to market unprepared.</p>`,

Use that time to clean up financials, resolve any outstanding legal or compliance issues, and strengthen the management team so the business isn't entirely dependent on you.</p><h2>Know your numbers</h2><p>Buyers will scrutinise your financials in detail. Make sure your revenue, EBITDA, and cash flow figures are clean, audited where possible, and presented in a way that makes the business easy to underwrite.</p><h2>Build your narrative</h2><p>Every business has a story. The best CIMs (Confidential Information Memorandums) clearly articulate what makes the business defensible, where the growth opportunity lies, and why now is the right time for a transaction.</p><h2>Choose the right advisor</h2><p>An experienced M&A advisor will help you position the business, identify the right buyers, manage the process, and negotiate terms that protect your interests through close.</p>`,

If a firm can't articulate their process clearly, that's a red flag.</p><h2>Regional expertise</h2><p>For cross-border transactions in Asia, local knowledge is not optional.
