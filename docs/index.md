# BizMatch Asia - Project Documentation

## Project Overview & Vision

BizMatch Asia is a full-stack platform designed as a marketplace to connect Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) owners in Asia looking to sell their businesses with interested investors and buyers. The platform aims to facilitate these connections through a trusted, user-friendly interface, supported by manual verification processes for users and listings to ensure quality and authenticity.

**Core Goals:**
- Provide a centralized platform for sellers to list their businesses (anonymously at first, with more details available to verified buyers).
- Enable buyers to browse, filter, and search for business opportunities.
- Facilitate initial engagement between buyers and sellers.
- Offer a manual verification service for both buyers and sellers to build trust.
- Implement a monetization strategy based on subscription fees for verified user statuses.

**Key User Roles:**
- **Anonymous User:** Can browse basic listing information.
- **Registered Buyer (Anonymous):** Can make initial inquiries.
- **Verified Buyer:** Can view detailed listing information and engage more deeply.
- **Registered Seller (Anonymous):** Can create anonymous listings.
- **Verified Seller:** Listings gain more trust and can display more details to verified buyers.
- **Platform Admin/Team:** Manages users, listings, verification processes, and platform analytics.
