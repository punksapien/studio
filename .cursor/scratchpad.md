# Nobridge Project - Backend Implementation: Supabase

## Background and Motivation

Nobridge is an ambitious B2B marketplace platform connecting SME business owners in Asia with buyers/investors. It's essentially "Flippa for Asian SMEs" but with sophisticated verification workflows, admin-mediated connections, and built-in messaging.

**Current State**: Complete Next.js frontend with impressive UI/UX, comprehensive user flows, and detailed TypeScript interfaces. All data currently comes from placeholder files.

**Goal**: Build a complete backend to make this static frontend into a fully functional marketplace that can launch within 4 weeks.

**Current Goal**: Implement the backend using Supabase to make the platform fully functional. This involves setting up the database, authentication, storage, and business logic (API endpoints/serverless functions) based on the designs in `docs/` and `cursor-docs/`.

**Key Documents Referenced:**
- `docs/index.md`: Project overview and vision.
- `docs/backend-todos.md`: Detailed list of backend functionalities (originally for Cloudflare, now adapted for Supabase).
- `docs/data-structures.md`: TypeScript interfaces defining data models.
- `cursor-docs/03-database-schema.md`: PostgreSQL schema for Supabase.
- `cursor-docs/05-api-design.md`: REST API endpoint specifications.

The existing plan in this scratchpad already recommended Supabase and laid out a general timeline, which we will now refine and execute.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### Technical Complexity Assessment: HIGH
- **Multi-role system**: 3 user types (buyer/seller/admin) with different dashboards
- **Complex state machines**: Inquiry → Engagement → Admin facilitation → Chat workflows
- **Real-time messaging**: Admin-facilitated chat between verified users
- **Verification system**: Manual document review and approval workflows
- **Advanced marketplace**: Filtering, search, pagination, multiple content tiers

### Business Requirements
- **Trust-first approach**: Manual verification builds credibility
- **Admin-mediated connections**: Platform facilitates high-value conversations
- **Subscription model**: Tiered pricing for enhanced features
- **Asia-focused**: Regional specialization for SME market

**Supabase Specific Considerations:**
- **RLS Policies**: Implementing robust Row Level Security is critical for data protection and multi-tenancy.
- **Edge Functions vs. Database Functions**: Deciding where to implement business logic (e.g., complex validation, triggers).
- **Realtime Setup**: Configuring realtime for messaging and notifications.
- **Storage Management**: Setting up buckets and policies for user uploads (e.g., verification documents, listing images).
- **Auth Hooks**: Potentially using Supabase Auth hooks for custom logic post-registration or login.

## Planner's Recommendations

### Technology Stack Choice: Supabase + Vercel
**Decision Rationale**:
- **Speed over perfection**: 1-2 week timeline vs 5-6 weeks with alternatives
- **Built-in features**: Auth, real-time, storage, admin UI out of the box
- **PostgreSQL power**: Complex queries, JSON fields, full-text search
- **Reduced infrastructure work**: Focus on business logic, not setup

**Alternative Considered**: Cloudflare Workers + D1 + R2
- **Pros**: Global performance, cost optimization at scale
- **Cons**: More infrastructure setup, custom implementations needed
- **Verdict**: Better for post-MVP optimization, not initial launch

### Chat Service Decision Matrix
**Supabase Realtime Chat Component** wins for our use case:

| Service | Cost | Pros | Cons | Verdict |
|---------|------|------|------|---------|
| **Supabase Realtime** | $0 (bundled) | Drop-in React component, full backend | Limited advanced features | ✅ **Perfect for MVP** |
| Twilio Conversations | $0.05/MAU | Global infra, SMS bridge | Additional service cost | Future consideration |
| ChatKitty | $79/mo | Pre-built UI | Fixed cost regardless of usage | Over-engineered for MVP |
| Stream/Sendbird | $399+/mo | Enterprise features | Expensive for startup | Post-scale consideration |

**Decision**: Start with Supabase built-in chat, migrate to Twilio if we need SMS/WhatsApp integration later.

### Supabase vs Firebase Strategic Analysis
**Why Supabase wins for Nobridge:**

| Factor | Supabase | Firebase | Winner |
|--------|----------|----------|---------|
| **Data Model** | PostgreSQL (SQL, joins, triggers) | Firestore (NoSQL, query limitations) | ✅ **Supabase** - Perfect for marketplace |
| **Self-hosting** | Yes (Docker, cloud portability) | No (Google lock-in) | ✅ **Supabase** - Future flexibility |
| **Cost Predictability** | Fixed tiers, clear add-ons | Pay-per-read uncertainty | ✅ **Supabase** - Budget certainty |
| **Real-time** | PostgreSQL → WAL → WebSockets | Firestore streams | ✅ **Supabase** - Simpler architecture |
| **Vendor Lock-in** | Low (SQL + open APIs) | High (proprietary APIs) | ✅ **Supabase** - Migration possible |
| **Our Use Case** | Relational data, complex queries | Chat works, but joins are painful | ✅ **Supabase** - Natural fit |

**Firebase Advantages We're Trading Off:**
- Mobile analytics (FCM, Crashlytics) - Not critical for web-first B2B
- Larger ecosystem - Supabase ecosystem growing rapidly
- Battle-tested scale - We'll address if/when we hit scale issues

### Analytics Strategy (Minimal Viable)
**Phase 1 (MVP)**: Custom events table in Supabase
```sql
CREATE TABLE user_events (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES user_profiles(id),
  event_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL, -- 'listing_viewed', 'inquiry_sent', etc.
  event_data JSONB, -- Additional context
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**Phase 2 (Post-Launch)**: Add PostHog for funnel analysis
- **Cost**: $0 for first 1M events/month
- **Integration**: Drop-in JavaScript + user ID mapping
- **Value**: Conversion funnel optimization

**Phase 3 (Scale)**: Consider Metabase for SQL dashboards
- Self-hosted on same infrastructure
- Direct PostgreSQL integration
- Custom business intelligence

### Architecture Overview
```
Frontend: Next.js 15 + TypeScript + ShadCN UI (✅ Complete)
Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Storage + Realtime Chat)
Deployment: Vercel + Email Service (Resend)
Analytics: Custom events → PostHog (post-MVP)
Error Tracking: Sentry (free tier)
```

### Refined Timeline Estimate
**MVP Timeline: 1-2 weeks** (Revised down from 3 weeks)

**Why This Timeline is Realistic**:
- Frontend already complete (saves 4-6 weeks)
- Supabase handles most complex parts (auth, real-time, storage, chat)
- Clear TypeScript interfaces guide implementation
- Most tasks are integration work, not new development

**Major Risk Eliminated**:
- Real-time messaging complexity → Using Supabase drop-in React chat component
- Custom WebSocket management → Handled by Supabase Realtime
- Message UI development → Pre-built component with Tailwind styling

**Cost**: ~$65/month (Supabase Pro $25 + Vercel Pro $20 + Email $20)
**Chat Cost**: $0 additional (bundled in Supabase Pro)

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

### 🎯 READY FOR TESTING PHASE!

**Current Status**: All onboarding implementation is complete! Both buyer and seller flows are now integrated with real APIs.

**Next Critical Steps**:

1. **Apply Database Migrations** (User Action Required):
   ```sql
   -- First, apply the main migration:
   -- Copy and run: database-migrations/01-add-onboarding-fields.sql

   -- Then, apply the storage setup:
   -- Copy and run: database-migrations/02-create-storage-bucket.sql
   ```

2. **Test Complete Flow**:
   - Register as buyer → Should redirect to `/onboarding/buyer/1`
   - Complete onboarding steps → Should redirect to `/dashboard`
   - Register as seller → Should redirect to `/onboarding/seller/1`
   - Complete onboarding steps → Should redirect to `/seller-dashboard`

**What's Been Implemented**:

✅ **Buyer Onboarding (2 steps)**:
- Step 1: Profile completion (name, country, investment focus)
- Step 2: Identity document upload

✅ **Seller Onboarding (5 steps)**:
- Step 1: Business overview (company name, website, country, summary)
- Step 2: Identity document upload
- Step 3: Business registration & ownership documents
- Step 4: Financial documents (P&L, balance sheet)
- Step 5: Review & confirmation

✅ **Security & Flow Control**:
- Middleware blocks dashboard access until onboarding complete
- Documents stored securely in Supabase Storage with RLS
- Onboarding state persisted across browser sessions
- Real-time API integration with proper error handling

### Architecture Summary

**Complete Flow**:
```
Registration →
  ↓ (automatic redirect)
Onboarding Steps (2 for buyers, 5 for sellers) →
  ↓ (middleware enforces completion)
Dashboard Access (role-based routing)
```

**Key Features**:
- ✅ Document upload with 5MB limit and file type validation
- ✅ Session storage maintains form state across steps
- ✅ Real-time onboarding progress tracking
- ✅ Automatic dashboard routing after completion
- ✅ Secure file storage with user-only access

## Lessons

- Use @supabase/ssr instead of deprecated auth-helpers packages
- Always check networking connectivity before running remote database commands
- Include manual fallback steps for critical migrations
- Session storage in onboarding flow maintains form state across steps
- **NEW**: Supabase Storage RLS policies require careful folder structure matching user IDs
- **NEW**: File upload APIs need proper error handling for size and type validation

- More logical onboarding step progression
- Simplified public path handling

🚨 **CRITICAL BUG**:
Skip pattern `"/"` is matching ALL routes because `pathname.startsWith("/")` is true for every path. This causes middleware to skip ALL routes including onboarding pages.

**Evidence from logs**:
```
🔥 [MIDDLEWARE DEBUG] Skip pattern "/" matches /onboarding/buyer/2
🔥 [MIDDLEWARE DEBUG] Should skip /onboarding/buyer/2: true
🔥 [MIDDLEWARE DEBUG] Skipping: /onboarding/buyer/2
```

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

**IMMEDIATE ACTION NEEDED**:
1. Fix the root path skip pattern bug that's causing all routes to be skipped
2. Remove old debug logging from previous middleware version
3. Test the corrected middleware properly processes onboarding routes
4. Verify login/authentication works with the new middleware structure

**STATUS**: Critical bug preventing protection system from working - middleware skipping all routes due to faulty pattern matching.
