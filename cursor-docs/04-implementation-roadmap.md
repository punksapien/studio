## Success Criteria for MVP

### Core Functionality Working
✅ **User Registration & Authentication**
- Users can register as buyers or sellers
- Email verification works
- Profile management functional

✅ **Marketplace Operations**
- Sellers can create and manage listings
- Buyers can browse and search listings
- Filtering and search work accurately

✅ **Connection System**
- Buyer inquiry → Seller engagement → Admin facilitation
- Real-time messaging between verified users
- Status tracking throughout the process

✅ **Admin Management**
- User and listing verification
- Platform oversight and moderation
- Analytics and monitoring

### Technical Requirements Met
- **Performance**: Page loads under 2 seconds
- **Security**: All data properly protected with RLS
- **Scalability**: Can handle 100 concurrent users
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime during testing period

## Risk Mitigation

### High Risk Items
1. **Real-time messaging complexity** → Start with simple polling, upgrade later
2. **Admin workflow complexity** → Focus on core functions first
3. **Verification system scope** → Manual process initially, automate later

### Backup Plans
- **If messaging is complex**: Use simple email notifications initially
- **If verification is too complex**: Start with basic approved/rejected status
- **If admin panel is overwhelming**: Create minimal management interface

## Post-MVP Roadmap (Future)

### Month 2: Enhanced Features
- Advanced search and recommendations
- Payment integration for subscriptions
- Enhanced messaging (file sharing, etc.)
- Mobile app development

### Month 3: Scale & Optimize
- Automated verification systems
- AI-powered matching
- Advanced analytics
- International expansion features

This roadmap balances ambition with practicality, ensuring you can launch a functional marketplace in 4 weeks while building a foundation for future growth.
